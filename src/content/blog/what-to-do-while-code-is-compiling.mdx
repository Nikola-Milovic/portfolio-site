Unless you're using a BLAZING FAST 🔥🔥🔥 technologies🛠️ you're probably waiting😴 for code to compile, for tests to run, for Android Studio to load up... Okay jokes aside, I mostly used the title as it sounded catchy, but in this post I wanted to take a look at what you can do during your breaks or better yet to say what I do. Of course this is highly opinionated, but I'll try and list many things that you can try and see if they fit your lifestyle (as you probably can't do handstands and splits if you are working in an office...). This is mainly targeted towards people with sedentary lifestyle, regardless of fitness level or gender. Without further ado, here we go.

## Introduction

DODATI OVDE NESTO

Ahhh, there's so much to say but people just skim through everything, I'll try and keep every meaty part of this article in a separate section and keep the important topics bold.

As you'll see, I'll usually send you on your way to more reputable sources and people with expertise in the given topic. There is no reason for me to give you a copy paste of other peoples words, usually reworded much worse than the original. But I do encourage you to go and skim through the resources I refer to

First let us mention a couple of popular topics on this subject and get on the same page. These are some of the myths, advice and common excuses you will find all over the internet. As always, research used in this article can be found down below.

#### Sitting is killing you

Okay, get this one out of the way, sitting is not bad for you and sitting is not killing you, BUT prolonged sitting is very bad for you. Here's the catch, everything in excess is bad for you, we are made to be amazing at everything but with consideration, our body is great at adapting to external stress given the time to recover and adapt, so doing activities in segments and taking breaks is the way to go. This also goes for standing desks, prolonged standing is just as bad as prolonged sitting (debatable), [the key is to alternate between the two][1] with breaks in between.

#### 20-20-20 rule

Alright, you probably know this one, if not here's a brief summary of the rule

> look away every 20 minutes at an object that is about 20 feet >away for a full 20 seconds.

Basically your eyes are also compromised of muscles, these muscles give you the ability to focus on things and move your vision around. And as any muscle these can get strained and can ache, so it's important to stretch them out regularly. (I am overly simplifying things but that's the gist of it, the eye muscles aren't exactly the same as your bicep for example, and how they fatigue and recover is also different. )

For more details [check out this post][2].

#### I don't have the time/ space...

This one is bolognie, you may not have the hours to dedicate every week to go to the gym, but for most people that's not necessary. Especially if you have a family, or other time consuming obligations, your goal should primarily be to keep your body healthy enough to not hinder your day to day life. That means playing sports with your children/ friends, going hiking, carrying shopping bags... So how can you achieve this level of fitness? Just move, if you can sneak in some of the stretches and exercises I'll mention later, alongside at least ~20 minutes of dedicated "workouts" a day, that should suffice, remember only one thing from this, MOVING IS IMPROVING, if you're moving, that's already enough.

Spacial excuse is even worse, one can stretch in their chair or take a walk.

### How often should you take breaks?

Alright, ideally, every 20 or so minutes, realistically I try to go for 40 minutes of focused work, after that I get up and stretch my eyes, legs and preferably entire body or my upper body. So my ideal goal is around every 40 minutes I'd take a break, BUT there are legit cases where you wait for your program/ code to do something, be it compile, run, check, lint... in those cases try and do light stretches on your desk. Every 3,4 hours ideally you'd stop working entirely and do something else, taking a walk is great, but I personally like going into my yard if the day is nice, I hate walks. My recommendations for exercises will be below.

### Full body breaks

These are your breaks every 40 minutes or so, I usually start with shaking my head a bit, and stretching my wrists, usually while doing this I'll do my eye stretching through my window. I'll take some kind of stone or mark on a tree and focus on that. But besides that, I've found that moving my eyes to the sides slowly and up and down also helps relieve the tension as well.

##### In office

I've been mostly working remotely, so I cannot give out many personal advice, but try walking around, maybe going to the bathroom and sneaking in a couple of squats and leg raises. Probably just taking a walk and putting your hands on your head is the best way to go.

##### At home

Alright, here you have no excuses, you can do whatever you want to, and I recommend to do just that. Move however you feel like, a bit of a walk, crab walk, light yoga, dynamic stretching, hanging from a bar, you name it, there are so many options here.

### Short breaks

These breaks are literally while waiting for your code to compile < 2 min breaks where you won't be getting up. Again, personally I often forget to use a minute or two to loosen up and instead I alt tab and scroll the documentation or the stackoverflow question I was just copy pasted to see if it will work. But every so often this time can be used to stretch out your wrists and neck, move your hands around a bit, move your ankles in a circular motion... Mostly just loosening up, whatever feels nice.

Honestly I don't adhere to all of these myself, I get too consumed by the work and I even forget to keep proper posture and become hunched over like a goblin, but I try and take regular breaks and make the most out of them. The biggest hurdle for people is that their breaks are either social media or standing in the same place talking to someone. I remember being at a workshop that was several hours long with breaks in between. Every 40 minutes or so was a small break, I immediately took the opportunity to get up and walk around as I was stiff as hell, but majority of people just pulled out their phone and kept sitting. Not that I judge them or am trying to act like those life gurus that social media is like a disease and what not, but rather at least get up and be on your phone. I personally scroll social media and sit on a stationary bike for couple of minutes. It's enough for a short break, gets the blood flowing and prevents me from being on social media for too long.

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**: Everything should be adapted to your specific needs and environment, but never neglect moving around. I will repeat and shout this if I need to, MOVING IS GOOD FOR YOU, it sounds absurd but doing 5 squats while going to the bathroom does matter.
