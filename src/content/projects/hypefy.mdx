# Introduction

I came to Hypefy at the very beginning of the startup, I was tasked with
developing the initial MVP that was used to validate the idea and be presented
to the investors. After the initial prototype, our cooperation went smoothly and
I proceeded to develop the Alpha version of the platform. At the time of writing
we scored 3 rounds of investements, built up a sizeable amount of influencers
and businesses in our database and started getting regular customers out of
previous clients. The application is soon nearing the Beta stage and more and
more features are being added.{' '}

# My responsibilities

As the Lead Developer, and the only developer at the beginning, I firstly had to
choose our tech stack and take lay out the architecture, coding stlye and practices
we will have in the future. The aspects I took into consideration when choosing the
the technologies were: quick iteration, flexible, familiarity, ease of scaling and
transitioning. As a marketing startup we have to deal with a lot of data, most of
which the format was unknown upfront, so the technologies chosen had to be flexible
and extensible to accommodate the regular changes to our data needs. Besides flexibility
it was important that I was proficient in those technologies considering it'll be
a while before the team expands, also the technologies had to be widely used to make
our time of finding developers a lot simpler. Without putting too much emphasis,
but still keeping it in mind, I wanted to make sure that we could easily transition
to a different database, hosting provider, data hosting service... For the initial
releases of the platform the emphasis was on the customer acquisition and market
validation but also keeping our options open for the future.{' '}

<br />

Currently I have developed the two customer facing Websites, one for each customer type, alongside internal tooling and Admin dashboard, and the server that connects all of these platforms. My normal day would consist of developing new feature requests, fix existing issue or bugs that come up during the QA testing, writing and evolving our test cases, making sure the release cycle is going smoothly.

To ease the mind burden of all of these responsibilities, I immediatelly started with split environment development, this would make it easy to be sure that whatever going into production had to go through rigorous testing in the staging environment that mimics the production closely.

<br />
Key takeaways of my responsibilities:
<br />

- Development
- Testing
- Release management
- Database management and migrations
