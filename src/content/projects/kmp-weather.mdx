## Kotlin Multiplatform Weather App

This was a fun little pet project that got me working with Kotlin Multiplatform. I started seeing Kotlin Multiplatform craze and wanted to see what it was all about, making this little Application was super fun. With 90% of the same codebase I got IOS, Android and Desktop applications running, the only thing that differs is the Native IOS UI written in Swift.

Sharing code between mobile platforms is one of the major Kotlin Multiplatform use cases. With Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, you can build cross-platform mobile applications and share common code between Android and iOS, such as business logic, connectivity, and more.
