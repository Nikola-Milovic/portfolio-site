## Introduction

<br />

This was a fun little pet project that got me working with Kotlin Multiplatform. I started seeing Kotlin Multiplatform craze and wanted to see what it was all about, making this little Application was super fun. With 90% of the same codebase I got IOS, Android and Desktop applications running, the only thing that differs is the Native IOS UI written in Swift.

<br />

Sharing code between mobile platforms is one of the major Kotlin Multiplatform use cases. With Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, you can build cross-platform mobile applications and share common code between Android and iOS, such as business logic, connectivity, and more.
